# ProgrammingII 🚀

## HELLO MY GUYS
 Buckle up your seats, cause in a few short mins, I'm going to teach you something that I only learned 2 hours ago. So sit down, shut up and enjoy the experience of my 4am caffeine induced self hatred (Kush not intended) fueled writing extravaganza

## 🧐 What is this?

A collection of Python wizardry and Makefile mischief crafted by *1 guy without a belt, a guy who had 3 liters of coke and a guy who just showed up from Munich on the day before project*.  
Whether you’re here to contribute, learn, or steal out code, we’re glad you stopped by!

## 🐍 Tech Stack

- **Python**: 89.6% of our code and 100% of our problems
- **Makefile**: 10.4% automation, 90% confusion
- **Money**: 0%

## 📦 How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**  
   `git clone https://github.com/AshinMc/ProgrammingII.git`

2. **Install dependencies**  
   If we had any, you’d find them here. For now, just bring your best Python interpreter.

3. **Run the code**  
   `python main.py or python dice.py`

4. **Profit?**
